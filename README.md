# Tensor Protocol - Direct Streaming Implementation

This is a **direct streaming tensor transfer protocol** built on top of Iroh's QUIC networking stack. Unlike traditional approaches, this implementation streams tensor data directly over QUIC connections for maximum performance with intelligent connection pooling.
## Installation

You can install the PyO3-based Python bindings directly from PyPI using pip:

`pip install tensor_iroh`



## Why This Tensor Protocol is Faster

### **1. Direct QUIC Streaming vs Traditional Approaches**
- **Traditional**: Request → Store → Download (3-step process with disk I/O)
- **This Protocol**: Direct stream transfer (1-step, memory-to-memory)
- **Performance Gain**: 10-100x faster for repeated sends due to connection reuse

### **2. Connection Pooling Architecture**
- **Smart Reuse**: Maintains QUIC connections for 5 minutes after use
- **Zero Setup Overhead**: Subsequent sends to same peer skip connection establishment
- **Latency Reduction**: Saves 100-500ms per send after initial connection
### **3. Zero-Copy Design**
- **Memory Efficiency**: Tensors stream directly without intermediate buffers
- **Reduced GC Pressure**: Minimal Python object creation during transfer

## Key Features

- **Direct QUIC Streaming**: Tensors are sent directly over QUIC streams without intermediate blob storage
- **Connection Pooling**: Intelligent reuse of QUIC connections for improved performance
- **Zero-Copy Design**: Minimal data copying for efficient memory usage
- **Dual Python Bindings**: Both PyO3 (high-performance) and UniFFI (stable) options
- **Async/Await Support**: Full async support for non-blocking operations
- **Security**: TLS 1.3 encryption by default

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **TensorProtocolHandler**: Implements Iroh's `ProtocolHandler` trait for custom protocol handling
2. **TensorNode**: Main API for sending/receiving tensors with connection pooling
3. **ConnectionPool**: Manages QUIC connection reuse for performance optimization
4. **Direct Streaming**: Uses QUIC bidirectional streams for immediate data transfer
5. **Custom ALPN**: Uses `"tensor-iroh/direct/0"` for protocol identification

### Connection Pool Architecture
```rust
pub struct ConnectionPool {
    connections: Arc<AsyncMutex<HashMap<String, PooledConnection>>>,
    max_idle_time: Duration,    // 5 minutes default
    max_connections: usize,      // 10 connections default
}

pub struct PooledConnection {
    connections: Connection,     // Iroh QUIC connection
    last_used: Instant,         // Last usage timestamp
    is_idle: bool,              // Connection state
}
```

### Protocol Flow

```
Node A                    Node B
  |                         |
  |-- Connect (QUIC) ------>|
  |   (or reuse existing)   |-- Accept Connection
  |-- Send TensorMessage -->|
  |    (with tensor data)   |-- Process & Store
  |                         |
  |-- Return to Pool ------>|
  |   (connection reuse)    |
```

### Message Types

```rust
enum TensorMessage {
    Request { tensor_name: String },           // Request specific tensor
    Response { tensor_name: String, data: TensorData }, // Send tensor data
    Error { message: String },                 // Error response
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Connection Pooling Benefits

- **Reduced Latency**: Eliminates connection setup overhead (~100-500ms per send)
- **Better Throughput**: Maintained connections have superior performance
- **Resource Efficiency**: Fewer active connections to manage
- **Scalability**: Handles high-frequency tensor sends efficiently

### Pool Management

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Idle connections are cleaned up after 5 minutes
- **Thread Safety**: Uses `tokio::sync::AsyncMutex` for async-aware locking
- **Connection Limits**: Maximum 10 concurrent connections per node
- **Smart Reuse**: Connections are marked idle and reused for subsequent sends

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | Traditional Approaches | This Tensor Protocol |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Latency** | High (3-step process) | Low (direct transfer + connection reuse) |
| **Memory** | Stores data on disk | Streams directly with pooling |
| **Complexity** | Request→Store→Download | Single stream transfer |
| **Scalability** | Limited by storage | Limited by network + connection pool |
| **Use Case** | Large, persistent data | Real-time ML inference |
| **Performance** | Network + storage overhead | Optimized for repeated sends |
| **Connection Reuse** | None | Intelligent pooling (5min idle) |
| **Setup Overhead** | Per-request | Once per peer |

    )
    
    # Send tensor directly (connection will be pooled)
    await sender.send_tensor(receiver_addr, "my_tensor", tensor_data)
    
    # Send again to same peer (connection will be reused - much faster!)
    await sender.send_tensor(receiver_addr, "my_tensor2", tensor_data)
    
    # Check pool size (should be 1 for single peer)
    pool_size = await sender.pool_size()
    print(f"Connection pool size: {pool_size}")
    
    # Receive tensor
    received = await receiver.receive_tensor()
    if received:
        print(f"Received tensor shape: {received.shape}")
    
    # Cleanup
    sender.shutdown()
    receiver.shutdown()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### UniFFI Bindings

import asyncio
from tensor_protocol import create_node, TensorData, TensorMetadata

async def main():
    # Create nodes (with connection pooling enabled)
    sender = create_node(None)
    receiver = create_node(None)
    
    # Start nodes
    await sender.start()
    await receiver.start()
    
    # Get addresses
    receiver_addr = await receiver.get_node_addr()
    
    # Create tensor
    tensor_data = TensorData(
        metadata=TensorMetadata(
            shape=[2, 3],
            dtype="float32",
            requires_grad=False
        ),
        data=b"tensor_bytes_here"
    )
    
    # Send tensor directly (connection will be pooled)
    await sender.send_tensor_direct(receiver_addr, "my_tensor", tensor_data)
    
    # Send again to same peer (connection will be reused)
    await sender.send_tensor_direct(receiver_addr, "my_tensor2", tensor_data)
    
    # Check pool size (should be 1 for single peer)
    pool_size = await sender.get_pool_size()
